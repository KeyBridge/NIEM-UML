NIEM-UML
========
The UML Profile for NIEM (better known as NIEM-UML) is an Object Management Group (OMG) specification for modelers and developers to produce NIEM-conformant exchanges using the Unified Modeling Language (UML).

NIEM-UML is an extension of a subset of UML that is specific to NIEM. 

NIEM-UML is a specification. It needs to be implemented in a UML modeling tool in order to generate NIEM-conformant XML schema.

When implemented in a tool, it generates NIEM-conformant information exchanges and can assist in domain model management!

The current work effort is to udpate the NIEM-UML profile to **[NIEM version 3.0](https://niem.gov/version3)**. We invite you to join the submission team as a contributor or reviewer. We expect to have conference calls every other week to discuss updates and items that require a decision. If you would like to be added to the team distribution list, please reach out to us **[here](https://niem.gov/contactus)**.
