NIEM-UML
========
The UML Profile for NIEM (better known as NIEM-UML) is an Object Management Group (OMG) specification for modelers and developers to produce NIEM-conformant exchanges using the Unified Modeling Language (UML).

NIEM-UML is an extension of a subset of UML that is specific to NIEM. 

NIEM-UML is a specification. It needs to be implemented in a UML modeling tool in order to generate NIEM-conformant XML schema. When implemented in a tool, it generates NIEM-conformant information exchanges and can assist in domain model management!

This specification has been submitted to the Object Management Group for final adoption.
